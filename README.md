Link shortener that takes advantage of Netlify redirection system. In simple terms, the file
"\_redirects" in the repository gives Netlify the indication to redirect the endings of the
repository url to the desired url.

This results in a fairly fast, free and customised redirector. The latter taking into account that
with Netlify you can:

-  Change the domain at will (as long as you have one).
-  It allows us to have the shortening that we want simply by modifying the file "\_redirects".
-  It's free :D

First of all, to personalize this project to your liking you can create a fork and _voil√†_. You will
have an integrated copy of the project in your repositories.

## **How ?**

This repository use the npm package [netlify-shortener](https://rubn.xyz/ztWYE). It does most of the
work. Since, by means of this one, the addition of new url in the file "\_redirects" and the push to
the repository in Github is made to be able to execute the construction of the project.

   -  `cd path/to/your/repo`

   -  `npm install`

3. Modify the homepage at `package.json`. This allows to **netlify-shortener** create a string with
   the base of the url and the new ID for the redirect. Your `package.json` should be usually like
   this:

   ```json

      "author": "YOUR INFO",
      "baseUrl": "https://BASE-URL-FROM-NETLIFY.com",

      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
         "shorten": "netlify-shortener"
      }
   }
   ```

4. Use the command to create the new short url. Now that you have configured the project you can use
   the command `npm run shorten` to:

   -  Format the list of urls.
   -  Create a new url with a random identifier.
   -  Create a new url with the identifier that you wish.
